# ChessTV - Traps

A simple app to view common traps in chess openings.

The moves have been extracted by looking at all openings on the Lichess opening's player's (ratings range between 1700-2400) database, evaluating only the top 3 moves, where each move is at least 30% likely to be chosen (I ignore moves that are rarely played).

Contributions welcome!
